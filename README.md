# AWS_Config_Project
This Project is created to implement continuous monitoring and compliance management of AWS resource. In the project, I have utilized a custom python boto3 script as a lambda function which will  identify, if "BlockPublicAccess" is enabled or disbaled for S3 buckets, and mark as COMPLIANT and NON-COPLIANT, if enabled and disabled.
